# AriseNg

This is an R Studio Project for everthing _**Arise Nigeria**_ and is being maintained for Nehemiah Apostolic Resource Centre, Abuja, Nigeria.

The project contains R scripts, Powershell scripts for certain jobs requiring some duct-tape, reports and, of course, data. The data, however are not included in this remote repository and can be obtained on request.

Yes, and I forgot to mention that there is an R package called *ariseng* within this project that contains functions to help with data collection...
